Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide. According to the Global Stroke Factsheet published in 2022, the lifetime risk of having a stroke has increased by 50% in the last 17 years, with 1 in 4 people over the age of 25 likely to experience a stroke. Each year, approximately 12.2 million individuals suffer their first stroke, and 6.5 million of them will die. The global number of stroke survivors exceeds 110 million, and stroke incidence has risen by 70% since 1990.

Stroke is especially prevalent in low- and middle-income nations, where 86% of stroke-related deaths and 89% of disability-adjusted life years are recorded. The World Stroke Organization identifies high systolic blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), elevated fasting plasma glucose levels, and low glomerular filtration rate as some of the critical metabolic risk factors associated with stroke. Smoking, unhealthy eating, lack of physical activity, environmental risks such as air pollution, and lead exposure further contribute to stroke prevalence.

This project explores various attributes leading to stroke, developing predictive models to help individuals assess their risk of stroke based on simple data inputs.
